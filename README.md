### Procedures

Used ggplot2 and dplyr to understand and visualize the links between different predictors & between some predictors and target variable.

Used caret package in R for preprocessing, splitting, training, parameter tuning, variable importance estimating and making predictions on the test data. Also used confusion matrix from the caret package to evaluate the performance of different machine learning models designed.
